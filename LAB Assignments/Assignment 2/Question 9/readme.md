**Approach:**
Generate the given gird. Based on user input ('w', 'a', 's', 'd'), the program calculates the new position of the player. It checks if the new position is within bounds and not blocked by an obstacle ('X'). If the move is valid, the playerâ€™s position on the grid is updated, and the player's new location is marked. If the player collects an item ('I'), a message is displayed. This process continues until the player quits the game or cannot make a valid move.

**What I learned:**
I learned how to use pointers to update the player's position on the grid and how to handle simple user input to control movement. It also taught me how to manage a grid of characters and check for valid moves.
