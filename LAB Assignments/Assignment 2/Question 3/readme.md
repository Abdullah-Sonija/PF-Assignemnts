**Approach:**
This program removes consecutive duplicate characters from each word using a helper function. The main function iterates through multiple words, applying the compression and tracking removed characters.

**What I learned:**
I learned to use helper functions for repeated tasks and how to keep track of changes across multiple inputs.
