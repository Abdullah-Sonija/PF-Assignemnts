**Approach:**
The program sorts each transaction and groups identical transactions together. It uses a helper function to sort the transactions alphabetically and then checks if the sorted transaction already exists in a group. If not, it creates a new group.

**What I learned:**
I learned how to efficiently group similar strings using sorting and how to manage dynamic groups with arrays.
