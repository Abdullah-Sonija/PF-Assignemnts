**Approach:**
The horizontal histogram prints stars (*) representing each value in a row. The vertical histogram prints the stars in columns, aligned based on the maximum value, with the numbers displayed at the bottom.

**What I learned:**
vertical histograms using loops and how to manage the alignment of elements based on the maximum value in the dataset.
